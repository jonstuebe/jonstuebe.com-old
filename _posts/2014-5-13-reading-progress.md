I was inspired by a few posts I've seen around, namely [this one](http://css-tricks.com/reading-position-indicator/) over at [css-tricks](http://css-tricks.com) discussing and showcasing some cool examples relating to showing progress on page as you scroll through it. I thought it would be useful to also integrate in a label that keeps track of your progress and gives you an estimated reading time left (similar to [medium.com](medium.com)) but with a live update as your scroll.


<p data-height="650" data-theme-id="6137" data-slug-hash="KrIex" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'></p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

I've gone ahead and created a jQuery plugin and released it on bower & github as well.
