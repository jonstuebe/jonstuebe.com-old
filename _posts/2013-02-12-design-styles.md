I've seen a lot of articles as of late that have been arguing about design trends. Skeuomorphism, Flat, or as [@sachagreif](http://twitter.com/sachagreif) termed google's current style, skeuominimalism. However my issue with all of this talk is so many people think that a specific style can leave your ui without varying level's of importance to the end user. I don't believe this to be the case. Any design style can create promote ui elements or in the end make them recognizable to the user. If this isn't being done, then it's the designer's fault, not the style.
