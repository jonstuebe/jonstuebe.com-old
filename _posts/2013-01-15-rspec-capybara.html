<p>Encountered a weird bug today. When I tried using the method visit (from capybara) I got an error telling me it did not exist. The solution was changing two lines in the spec_helper.rb. The first was requiring capybara explicitly:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}require 'capybara/rspec'{% endhighlight %}

<p>The second change was adding this line to the config block:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}config.include Capybara::DSL{% endhighlight %}
