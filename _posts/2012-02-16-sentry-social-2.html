<p>The guys over at <a href="http://twitter.com/cartalyst" target="_blank">@cartalyst</a> have been working away for quite some time on <a href="http://sentry.cartalyst.com/" target="_blank">Sentry</a>, and I just noticed this evening that they have released an add-on called <a title="Sentry Social" href="http://sentry.cartalyst.com/manual/sentry-social.v1.html" target="_blank">Sentry Social</a> which for me will be extremely beneficial and time saving for a number of projects I have coming up.<!--more--></p>

<p>Simply put itâ€™s a quick and easy way to connect your Sentry driven auth in your <a title="fuelphp" href="http://fuelphp.com" target="_blank">fuelphp</a> app to any oauth or oauth2 provider such as facebook and twitter giving easy login access to your users. My only question is does Sentry Social allow you to request specific privileges for facebook for example such as offline access?</p>
