<p>I was bothered by not having the option to add multiple songs to a playlist so I wrote this little script. It's still a little buggy, but essentially before selecting any songs click on the bookmarklet and then select each song by clicking on any area inside of the song list that isn't already clickable. This should light up the song row and a new button "Add to Playlist" should appear. The rest is self explanatory. At some point I will turn this into a full fledge chrome extension with other features that I feel have been missing.</p>
