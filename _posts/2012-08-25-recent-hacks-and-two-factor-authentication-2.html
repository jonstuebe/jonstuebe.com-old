<p>Recently it seems that all you hear about is another site getting hacked and hundreds of thousands of users information beings compromised. To most it probably seems as if there is no repercussion to this. However, I’ve noticed more and more people who I know practice good or even excellent password practices have had their logins compromised on other non-hacked sites such as facebook and twitter. Is this a coincidence? I think not. I don’t think the solution is simply to create new passwords or create a complex email reset backup plan. It’s simply to target the accounts with the highest amount of information (I would say facebook and your email), and turn on two factor authentication. For those of you that don’t know, two-factor authentication means that when you login, the site will require “something you know” as in your normal password, and “something you have”, like a keycode you receive via cell. Now I want to say first that when I first heard the idea of it, I simply decided it wasn’t for me as I thought that it meant that I needed to have my cellphone by my side every time I logged into my account. This simply isn’t the case as both facebook and gmail allow you authorize a computer thus only making you have to get that keycode via your cell once a month making your experience almost identical to those in the past. All I can say is, I’m so tired of seeing people’s accounts on facebook getting hacked and it’s time for people to make the easy and secure switch to two-factor authentication. It’s there, use it.</p>
