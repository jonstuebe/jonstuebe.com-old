<p>In the past when deciding which cms to build sites with I’ve always considered Wordpress to be one of the easiest options. However, a fully custom cms always seemed that much nicer simply because of the ease of editing for the client when all is said and done.<!--more--></p>

<p>Now with the use of Elliot Condon’s <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com">Advanced Custom Fields</a> plugin that argument no longer holds any weight. Not only is it dead simple to edit the sites I build with ACF, but I can complete the sites in half the time. The only question I struggle with is: are people willing and ok with their site being built with Wordpress, even if they paid a large sum of money for it?</p>
