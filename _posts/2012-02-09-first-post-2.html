<p>Welcome to the blog. I&#8217;d like to use this blog to talk about my current findings in the web development world. On top of that I would love for it to become a resource that I can use for myself to refer back to with articles, snippets, and tutorials. I plan to write an article or tutorial every week or two concerning front end topics such as jQuery, css3, html5, and backend topics such as node.js, ruby on rails, php frameworks (codeigniter, fuelphp), and oop. I hope you&#8217;ll find it interesting and learn more along with me.</p>
